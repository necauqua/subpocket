# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog], and this project uses [Forge versioning scheme] with addition of git build suffixes (`-git-$shortCommitHash`).

Dates in this file are in [Holocene Calendar] because it is amazing, logical and I want more people to know about it.
