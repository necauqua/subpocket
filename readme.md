[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/necauqua/subpocket.svg?label=last%20release&style=flat-square)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/subpocket/files)

A Minecraft mod which adds an infinite item storage capability to the game.

It is limited because those items can be placed
anywhere in small 160x70 field, overlapping each other as
number of item types increases.

Even in vanilla, this can cause trouble with organizing and finding
the needed items, not to speak about any modpacks.

## Installation
Install Forge following their installation instructions,
[download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/subpocket/files)
this mod jar file for your version of the game and place it into your 'mods' folder.
When updating, be sure to remove the old version as well.

## Contribution
I am open to accept sane PR's (fixing bugs,
adding localizations etc.), but if you want to add
features please make an issue or contact me in any
other way.

## Compiling
This mod uses ForgeGradle and you can follow a standard
routine of cloning and compiling such a project with the
following commands:
* `git clone https://github.com/necauqua/subpocket`
* `cd subpocket`
* `./gradlew.sh build` - on Windows use `gradlew.bat build`

You'll need to have JDK 8 and Git
installed for this.

Freshly compiled jar file of the mod will be sitting
in a `subpocket/build/libs` folder.

## License
This mod uses MIT, which is a permissive open-sourse
license that allows you to do pretty much anything with
the mod as long as you keep the license notice
(LICENSE file) with it. This file is included in mod's
jar-file, so you can just simply that file in any way
you could imagine.

## Usage in modpacks
As stated above, since this mod is licensed under MIT,
and you may freely use it in absolutely any way you want.

If you want to be extra nice then please tell me about adding it
to your modpacks - on Discord or Twitter for example, just because
I'm curious.
