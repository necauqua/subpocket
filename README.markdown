subpocket is a Minecraft mod which adds an infinite item
storage capability to the game.

It is limited in the way, that those items can be placed
anywhere in small 160x70 field, overlapping each other as
number of item types increases.

To gain this ability, player should do these simple steps:
* Survive for at least three hours
(number of hours can be configured).
When you do survive the required amount of time - look at
the vanilla clock in the inventory - it's tooltip should
say that you've survived long enough.
* Fight a wither and kill it. The hard part is that
your last hit should be done with bare hand. If you
did it properly, clock tooltip should disappear.
* Swallow a diamond. The easiest task, also you can
swallow it only if you did previous steps correctly.
* Get killed by the End Dragon. If you're playing in a
hardcore world(or you've configured it that way) you can
take half your health of damage instead of dying.

When all of these tasks are done you'll receive a paper
from long forgotten God of Space and Time, that'll grant
you a code, entering which by keyboard will open the
subpocket for you.
